# "Dragons vs. Heralds: Understanding the Impact of Early-Game Objectives on Match Victories"

By: Rebecca Wu

In this DSC80 course project, I utilized data on competitive League of Legends matches to attempt to answer the question of whether securing the first dragon or obtaining the first herald holds greater importance in contributing to victories. To complete this analysis, the project involved cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis, assessing missingness, and hypothesis testing.
